### Looking to 'code' the 🌎.

Hello there 👋🏼! My name is Mateo Morrison Jr (call me mateo) and I want to code the world! About five years ago I asked myself:

- 🤨 Can we 'code' our way out of some of the world's most complex problems?
- 📈 Is it possible to growth hack and (profitably) bootstrap multiple SaaS or small-businesses using a custom-built enterprise-grade corporate system?

The answer to both was yes! 👍 . Using my previous corporate and startup experience, I built Morrison Jr. & Co.,  a 'broke' private equity fund where we build, purchase or sell apps and startups. Basically, we apply a system 'In, Do, Out' that allows us to build companies in a shorter period of time.

### Can I 'copy' me? 🙋‍♂️
Was another answer I had years ago. And it was also possible, if the training data had enough variables to determine an outcome of any nature.

- 🕧 We waste too much time. How can I save some?
- 📈 The time that is not wasted, how to optimize it?

As you see, I'm obsessed with solutions. Learn more at https://github.com/mateomorrison/mateo
